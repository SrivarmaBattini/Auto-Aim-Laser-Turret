# ROS Based Auto Aim Turret System

## About the Project
This project implements a real-time auto aim turret system using ROS2. The system processes live camera input to detect a visual target and automatically adjusts a pan–tilt turret to keep a laser aligned with the target. The project focuses on real-time control, modular system design, and ROS-based communication running on embedded hardware.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- ROS2 (Robot Operating System)  
- OpenCV  
- Raspberry Pi  
- Servo Motor Control (PWM/GPIO)

## Image Processing Approach
The system uses classical OpenCV-based image processing techniques for real-time target detection and tracking. This includes color space conversion, segmentation, contour detection, and coordinate extraction. No machine learning or deep learning models are used.
